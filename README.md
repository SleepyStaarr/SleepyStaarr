ðŸ›¦ i mainly play ponytown only because of **one friend!!** if you want to interact then get to me thru dc or while im online!!
- may be online before work while im preparing. I'll be on a different tab so whisper to me if you wanna talk. 
^ but keep in mind i don't like interacting with most pt people, 99% of the time they're weirdos or ___it just doesn't work___ (i struggle with that, i can't keep some friendships because their personality doesn't match the one im looking for and etc etc, many reasons)

ðŸ›¦ I LOVE AVIATION AND GASK MASKS AND UHH INVINCIBLE

- other than being online for a friend, i have school, exams, a job (STAARR EMPLOYEMENT ERA)  and allat so don't expect me to constantly answer,,,,, i like my space
