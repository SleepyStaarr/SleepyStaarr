ðŸ›¦ i play ponytown only because of **one friend!!** if you want to interact then get to me thru dc or while im online!!

^ but keep in mind i don't like interacting with most pt people, 99% of the time they're weirdos or it just doesnt work

ðŸ›¦ I LOVE AVIATION AND GASK MASKS AND UHH INVINCIBLE

- other than being online for a friend, i have school, exams, job and allat so don't expect me to constantly answer,,,,, i like my space
